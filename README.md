# DS-217 Final Exam: Multiple Sclerosis Analysis

## Question 1: Data Preparation with Command-Line Tools
- Created the `prepare.sh` script
- Started by generating dirty data using `generate_dirty_data.py`
- While testing, I realized there were errors if I tried to output to the same file that was the input, so I opted to avoid multiple steps by using pipes in the clean-up steps
- Clean-up steps were to use `grep` and `sed` to remove comment lines, then remove empty lines, then replace double commas with a single comma
- The output of the clean-up was put into a cut step using a pipe to extract only the necessary columns, and the final output of this step was outputted to `ms_data.csv`
- A list of labels for an `insurance_type` variable was created using `echo`
- The terminal will display the number of entries in `ms_data.csv` using line count through `wc`
- The terminal will also display the first 8 lines of `ms_data.csv` using `head`

## Question 2: Data Analysis with Python
- Read `ms_data.csv` as a Pandas data frame and converted `visit_dates` to date format
- Used a dictionary to assign a random insurance type from `insurance.lst` to each unique `patient_id` value, then used that dictionary to populate `insurance` column in the data frame to ensure each patient had a consistent insurance type
- `visit_cost` column was generated by having each cell randomly generate a cost within a certain range for each insurance type; each insurance type was assigned an average cost, and the generated costs could fluctuate between 80-120% of that average
- Summary statistics for walking speed by education level and visit cost by insurance bype were calculated using `.groupby().mean()`
- Walking speed by age was fit to a linear regression to determine the effect of aging one year on walking speed, represented by the coefficient for `age`

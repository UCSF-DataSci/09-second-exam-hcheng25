# DS-217 Final Exam: Multiple Sclerosis Analysis

## Question 1: Data Preparation with Command-Line Tools
- Created the `prepare.sh` script
- Started by generating dirty data using `generate_dirty_data.py`
- While testing, I realized there were errors if I tried to output to the same file that was the input, so I opted to avoid multiple steps by using pipes in the clean-up steps
- Clean-up steps were to use `grep` and `sed` to remove comment lines, then remove empty lines, then replace double commas with a single comma
- The output of the clean-up was put into a cut step using a pipe to extract only the necessary columns, and the final output of this step was outputted to `ms_data.csv`
- A list of labels for an `insurance_type` variable was created using `echo`
- The terminal will display the number of entries in `ms_data.csv` using line count through `wc`
- The terminal will also display the first 8 lines of `ms_data.csv` using `head`

## Question 2: Data Analysis with Python
- Read `ms_data.csv` as a Pandas data frame and converted `visit_dates` to date format
- Used a dictionary to assign a random insurance type from `insurance.lst` to each unique `patient_id` value, then used that dictionary to populate `insurance` column in the data frame to ensure each patient had a consistent insurance type
- `visit_cost` column was generated by having each cell randomly generate a cost within a certain range for each insurance type; each insurance type was assigned an average cost, and the generated costs could fluctuate between 80-120% of that average
- Summary statistics for walking speed by education level and visit cost by insurance type were calculated using `.groupby().mean()`
- Walking speed by age was fit to a linear regression to determine the effect of aging one year on walking speed, represented by the coefficient for `age`
- Results of `analyze_visits.py` was output to the text file `analyze_visits_result.txt`
- Final data frame was written into `ms_data_insurance.csv` for use in the next question's Python script

## Question 3: Statistical Analysis
- Read `ms_data_insurance.csv` for previously generated `insurance` data
- Performed a multiple linear regression to determine average change in `walking_speed` per unit of `age` and average change in `walking_speed` by category of `education_level`
    - P>|t| values for all coefficients were less than 0.001, indicating the existence of a statistically signficant effect of `age` and `education_level` on `walking_speed`
- Summary statistics for `visit_cost` were printed for both the overall data and for each type of `insurance`
- Crude `age` coefficient was found for the linear regression model predicting `walking_speed` based on `age`, and adjusted `age` coeffcient was found using the multiple linear regression model predicting `walking_speed` based on both `age` and `education_level`
    - Comparing the difference in the crude and adjusted R2 values suggested that there is no confounding effecting by `education_level` on the relationship between `age` and `walking_speed`
- Interaction effects by `education_level` on the relationship between `walking_speed` and `age` were found by using a linear regression model with the formula `walking_speed~age*education_level`
    - The P>|t| values for the coefficient of `age:education_level[T.Graduate]` suggests there is some interaction effect on `age` and `walking_speed` at some categorical levels of `education_level`
- Results of `stats_analysis.py` was output to the text file `stats_analysis_result.txt`
- Boxplot for BMI by age group and scatterplot for walking speed by both age and education level were output to `bmi-by-age-group.jpg` and `walkspeed-by-age-edu.jpg` respectively
